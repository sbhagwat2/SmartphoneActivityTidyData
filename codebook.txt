Explanation of different variables in d3sum:

Complete list of all the extracted variables is included in the file "columns.txt".
Each column represents either mean or standard deviation for that measurement for
each specific subject and activity.

Column   Name           Type            Explanation
1        subject        Character       represents subjects. Values vary from 1 to 
                                        30.
2        activityName   Character       represents six different kinds of activities,
                                        WALKING
                                        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                                        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                                        SITTING
                                        STANDING
                                        LAYING
3 to 88: Meaning of different variable names can be 'synthesized' from different
'parts' that form the name. They are:
        t               Prefix to denote - Time domain signal
        f               Prefix to denote - Fast Fourier Tranform (FFT) of the signal
        Acc             Separated Accelaration signal from Accelarometer
        Body            body accelaration signal
        Gravity         gravity accelaration signal.
        Jerk            calculated Jerk signals from accelarometer and Gyrometer
        mag             Magnitude
        XYZ             either X- or Y- or Z- comonent
        mean            mean value of the parameter
        std             standard deviation of the parameter

All the data in 'd3sum' is summarized mean values of the parameters chosen.
